## Signing In

Everyone using the toy library signs in on the daily register at reception. This information informs the city council 
who is using the children's centre and helps them plan for the future.

Families often visit and play in the toy library without joining or between swapping sessions.

## Joining the Toy Library

There's a simple membership form to complete; we can assist if needed and we don't ask for I.D. or proof of address.

Since the pandemic, the toy library service is free.

## Borrowing Resources

Members can then choose books and toys to take home. Not sure what to borrow? We are there to help with play ideas and
choosing age appropriate books and toys.

We write down the list of of what you are taking home and we keep a copy. Some folk take a photo of this sheet each
time but we always have a copy if you lose yours.

## Taking Resources Home

Our games, puzzles and resources with bits and pieces are in plastic zip wallets, all labelled telling you what is stored
in it, how many pieces, etc.

### Bags

We usually have some donated plastic carrier bags available if you don't have one with you. Alternatively you can
purchase one of our canvas bags for a minimum donation of Â£3.50.

## Returning Resources

Resources can be kept at home for up to two months. We put the return date on your borrowing sheet to help you keep 
track of this.

If you want to return resources when we are closed, they can be left at the children's centre reception with your name.

Once a toy has been returned we clean it. Toys can't be borrowed again until they have been cleaned and during busy 
periods this can cause a delay in the availability of some of our more popular items.
