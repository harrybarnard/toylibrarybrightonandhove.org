### Finding The Toy Library

To get to the toy library, either ask for directions at reception or use the lift to the first floor. Once there you 
can be "buzzed" from the landing to the community rooms and toy library.

### Buggies and Prams

Buggies and prams can be parked in the buggy park by the lift or in the corridor outside the toy library. There is only 
space in the toy library for one sleeping infant in their pram or buggy.

### Toilets and Baby Changing

The accessible toilet, child toilet and baby changing facilities are all in the same corridor as the toy library.

### Community Cafe

The community cafe is downstairs via reception and children are welcome and catered for. Contact the [children's centre
reception](https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/children-and-education/childrens-services/tarner-childrens-centre)
for daily opening times.
