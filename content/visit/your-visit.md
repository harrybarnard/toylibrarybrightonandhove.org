## What to Expect

It can be a quiet or busy session as it depends on who turns up as appointments during our opening hours aren't
necessary.

Some families arrive at the start of the toy library session and stay to the end. Some juggle feeds, naps and swapping
toys. Others race in swap and go in a five minute turn around. Some users [contact us](/contact/) to make requests in 
advance which we leave for them in reception, but most folk enjoy their visits and use the time, however brief or long, 
to chat to other parents and carers and enjoy the interaction of their children.

Most adults sit on the floor with the children but we do have chairs if needed. No, you don't have to take your shoes 
off!

## Food, Drink and Baby Feeding

Children are allowed to eat if they are sitting and chairs are available for adults to help make bottle and breast 
feeding a more comfortable experience. Unfortunately we can't have hot drinks in the toy library.

## Staff

We have a toy library worker in each session to help you choose books and toys, answer questions about the Early Childhood
Project and direct you to other services available across the city. The worker also takes in returns, borrowings and
deals with new memberships and renewals.

## Who Can Use The Library

The drop in toy library sessions are open to anyone who lives with or works with young children aged up to 8 years.
Most of our borrowers come from Brighton and Hove, but a few travel from further afield. Any postcode can use the toy
library even if you aren't eligible to use the groups in Tarner Children's Centre.
